Welcome to my web application, Bookish! 
The purpose of this application is to provide users with a way to keep track of their books, as well as connect with other people. 
The basic premise is that users can make “shelves” where they can sort their books into different categories based on genre, rating, whether they have read it, or any other criteria. 
To begin using this application, make an account with the register page (for security, your password must be more than six characters and have at least one capital letter). 
Once you register, you should be automatically logged into the website. 
After reading the homepage, you can then navigate to the search tab. In the input box, enter the title of a book or an author. 
The page should return search results of books with titles or authors that match your search query. 
Click on one of the search results, and you will be brought to a page that contains a bunch of information about the book, including the page count, year published, and first line. 
From here, you can click “add to bookshelf”, bringing you to a popup where you can make new bookshelves and add books to them. 
The first time you make a bookshelf, the book that you are on will automatically be added to the bookshelf. Any subsequent times, the bookshelf will appear in the dropdown menu. 
Clicking on the “shelves” tab will allow you to see all the books and shelves you have, and clicking on any book’s cover will take you to its profile. 
The second feature of the app is the friend system. This system allows users to add other users and see their shelves. 
Using the friend search, search any other user’s username and click on their name to add them (searching “sample” will provide you with a sample friend to view). 
Going back to the “friends” tab, clicking on a friend’s name will now allow you to see their shelved books. You can also see the shelves of people that have friended you. 
Bookish also allows users to remove friends with the remove friends button.
